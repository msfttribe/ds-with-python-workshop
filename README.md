Installations
=============
Hey there! So you are ready to get started with Python for Data Science? 
Well, looks like you need to install a basic Software into your system first!

Ideally, we would expect every participant to have Python 3.7 (or any other 3+ version) installed on their systems.

## Python
We download Python 3.7 from the official website (visit [Python 3.7 Official Download Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-375/ "Python 3.7's Official Download Page")).

#### Windows Users
Scroll down and download [Windows 32-bit Installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.5/python-3.7.5.exe "Windows 32-bit Installer") or [Windows 64-bit Installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.5/python-3.7.5-amd64.exe "Windows 64-bit Installer") depending on your system (We highly recommend downloading *64-bit one*)

To Install, run the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the instructions on the screen.

#### Linux Users
Almost all Linux Distributions already have Python 3+ installed out of the Box. If you still want to test it, write the following commands into your Terminal / Bash
```shell
$ python
```
This will run the installed Python into your shell session.

#### MacOS Users
Same goes with MacOS users, if you donot have Python installed on your system, install it;

- [32-bit Binary](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.5/python-3.7.5-macosx10.6.pkg "32-bit Binary")
- [64-bit Binary](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.5/python-3.7.5-macosx10.9.pkg)
